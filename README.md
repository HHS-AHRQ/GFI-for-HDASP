# GFI-for-HDASP
This repository contains Government Furnished Information (GFI) related to the HDASP procurement.

Additional information about many of the specific subtasks in Task 2 can be found in MEPS public use file documentation and methodology reports.  For illustrative purposes, the Government has provided two sample monthly reports and documentation for two subtasks (programming for a statistical brief and programming for income editing and estimation).  These are neither the easiest nor the most difficult tasks.  These examples are purely illustrative and should not be in any manner construed as representing the Governmentâ€™s preferred practice or approach to the task(s).
